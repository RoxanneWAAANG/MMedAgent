He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color.

Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize\nC. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus\nD. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline"
